At Dream On, we believe in the transformative power of faith and the importance of dreaming big. Our mission is to inspire individuals to discover their God-given purpose and to live it out boldly. One of the ways we bring this vision to life is through our international missions—with Brazil standing as a vibrant center of impact.

## Why Brazil?

Brazil is a nation rich in culture, beauty, and spiritual hunger. Our connection with Brazil is rooted in a shared passion: to see lives awakened by hope and ignited with purpose. By partnering with local churches, leaders, and communities, we create environments where people can experience the love of Jesus and be encouraged to dream again.

## Our Mission Trips

Our trips to Brazil are immersive and transformational—not just for the communities we serve, but for every team member who participates. These trips are designed to build deep relationships, serve practical needs, and spread the Gospel in meaningful ways.

Here’s what our mission trips typically include:
- **Worship & Evangelism**: Leading worship nights and faith gatherings that uplift, restore, and inspire spiritual renewal.
- **Teaching & Testimony**:  Sharing the Word and personal stories that stir faith and help others walk into their God-given calling.
- **Youth & Community Events**: Hosting activities, games, and outreach events that connect with young people and families on a personal level.
- **Serving Local Churches**: Supporting pastors and church communities with encouragement, resources, and hands-on help.

## Lives Are Being Changed

We’ve witnessed countless testimonies from our time in Brazil—salvations, baptisms, healed hearts, and reignited dreams. But perhaps the most powerful transformations happen within the hearts of our own team members, who return home with renewed passion, perspective, and purpose.
