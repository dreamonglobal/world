For years, we've sensed the Holy Spirit stirring something in our hearts—an anticipation that He would soon ask us to step into something new. We didn't know what it would look like or where it would take us, but we knew He was preparing us.

Then the call came.

We were invited to minister in Pakistan, and as we prayed, we felt the urgency of the Lord going before us. With peace and conviction, we said yes.

### What We're Doing in Pakistan

**Three-Night Evangelistic Crusade in Karachi**
We're hosting a large-scale evangelistic event where people will have the opportunity to hear the gospel, receive Jesus, be discipled, and witness the power of the Holy Spirit through signs, wonders, and miracles. We believe these nights will mark lives forever.

**Building Water Wells**
We're visiting villages where we feel led to build water wells. For just $500, we can provide clean water and share the love of Jesus with an entire community. We've already helped build wells in Pakistan, and we're excited to see more come to life.

**Ministering in the Brick Kilns**
Many families in Pakistan live and labor in heartbreaking conditions in brick kilns. We'll be bringing hope, prayer, and practical support to these communities.

**Pastors & Leaders Conference**
We'll be encouraging and pouring into local pastors at a special event dedicated just to them—equipping those who are on the front lines of ministry in a challenging region.

**Visiting the Bible College**
A Bible college is being built in Pakistan, and we'll have the opportunity to minister there and support its growth for years to come.

**Parliament Visit**
By God's favor, we've been invited to visit Pakistan's Parliament to pray for the only Christian currently serving in their government—a powerful moment of encouragement and intercession.

### The Team

Ben Swartz, Jordan Powell, and John Peak will be representing Dream On on this historic trip. We go believing that God has already prepared the way.
